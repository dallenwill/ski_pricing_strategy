# Project Title

---

## Overview
Briefly describe what the project does and why it matters.

Example:  
This project analyzes ski resort ticket prices to find key factors that affect pricing and builds a model to predict fair prices for new resorts.

---

## Objective
What are you trying to achieve?

Example:
- Understand what drives pricing differences.
- Build a predictive model for ski ticket prices.
- Provide insights for pricing strategy.

---

## Data
What data do you use and where it comes from?

Example:
- Dataset: ski_resort_data.csv  
- Source: public dataset or company internal data  
- Features: state, snowfall, altitude, lifts, price, etc.

---

## Tools & Libraries
List key tools or languages you used.

Example:
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Project Workflow
1. Problem Definition  
2. Data Wrangling 
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
4. Feature Engineering
5. Modeling 
6. Reporting

---

## Results
Summarize main findings or performance.

Example:
- Top 3 features affecting price: altitude, snowfall, amenities  
- Model achieved RÂ² = 0.87  
- Prices in Colorado are ~40% higher than average
