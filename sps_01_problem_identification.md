# Ski Pricing Strategy
# 01 — Problem Identification

## Overview
This project explores what drives ski resort ticket prices. By analyzing resort features, weather conditions, and regional factors, the goal is to understand how these elements relate to pricing across different ski resorts.

## Problem Identification
Many ski resorts still use static or intuition-based pricing. This can lead to prices that don’t match real demand—too high on slow days or too low during peak conditions. Without a clear, data-driven understanding of what actually influences price, resorts may miss revenue opportunities or create inconsistent value for guests.

## Objectives
- Identify which factors most strongly affect ski ticket pricing.
- Understand how resort characteristics and weather relate to price differences.
- Provide a foundation for building a simple, data-driven pricing model in later steps.
